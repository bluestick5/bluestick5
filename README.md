- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Java, but I am still gaining experience and am willing to learn more
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I use and need to fix, honestly. Right now that means Smartsim and OpenRGB, specifically for my Cooler Master SK620 Black that does not currently have drivers.
